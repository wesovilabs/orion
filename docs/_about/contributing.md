# Contributing

The purpose of release v0.0.1 is to make Orion be `ready for production`. To achieve it, the [v0.0.1 issues](https://github.com/wesovilabs/orion/milestone/1) must be closed.

This is only the beginning! By the way, If you missed any action,  or you found a bug, please [create a new issue on Github or vote the existing ones](https://github.com/wesovilabs/orion/issues)!

--- 

Additionally, you can contribute to Orion by reviewing documentation and making it clearer for others  
or writing `Guides & Tutorials`.
